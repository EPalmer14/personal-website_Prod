            I was born September 7th, 2000 in Middlebury, VT. I grew up in the
            small town of Vergennes, VT, where I lived with my mom, dad, older
            brother Matteo, and younger brother Gideon. Vergennes is located in
            Addison County, not far from Lake Champlain. It is about a two hour
            drive to Montr√©al, four hours to Boston, and 5 hours to New York
            City.
